Autoboat
========

This repository contains code used for running the Autoboat, a 20' robotic surface vessel currently in development at the University of Santa Cruz under the directive of Professor Gabriel Elkaim. This respository is therefore likely to be of little interest to outsiders, though much of the support code is fairly modular. Groundstation software for this vessel is provided via the QGroundControl project and is not contained within this repository.

File layout
-----------
 * CAD - Contains CAD designs of both mechanical and electrical systems. The mechanical systems have been modeled in SolidWorks 2010 while the electrical schematics have been generated using KiCAD.
 * Code - This contains the software used for controlling the boat. Primarily Simulink and C control its operation and MATLAB and Python scripts assist in data parsing and analysis
 * Documentation - Various documents regarding this project are stored in this directory.
