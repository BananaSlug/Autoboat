# Electronics Mounting Board #

This directory contains Solidworks 2010 CAD files for a mounting board for the various onboard electronics onboard the boat. It fits inside a Wiegmann BN4161406SS electronics box. This includes a large capacitor, the Microchip Explorer16 development board, a 2035 stepper motor driver board, an ACS300 brushless DC motor driver board, and a 5V power regulator. Some screw terminal blocks also have mounting holes (they're all from Blue Sea Systems).

It was designed to be cut out of a non-conductive 1/4" material. The Corel Draw DXF file is included for use with a laser cutter.
