# Charger Mounting Plate #

This boat is designed to be laser cut out of 1/4" material, in our case MDF. It's used for mounting both a Wiegmann BN4161406SS electronics box as well as the Dual Pro Professional Series Quad Pro battery charger. It is designed to be mounted in the boat with the charger mounted on the left side. 

This board should then be attached to two 2x4s that run along the entire width with the 4" against the MDF. For each of the mounting holes in the MDF, 3/4" holes should be drilled through the 2x4s to allow for a socket wrench.
